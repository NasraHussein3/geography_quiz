## Introduction

This interactive Geography Quiz project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz features 10 multiple-choice questions with dynamic content, a user-friendly interface, and the application of various programming concepts. It's an educational tool designed to test your knowledge of geography in a fun and engaging way.

**Project Preview**: You can see a live preview of the project on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/NasraHussein3/pen/WNLpxaV).


## Features

### Dynamic Question Display

The project leverages JavaScript to dynamically display questions and answer choices. It uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and update the content as users progress through the quiz.


###Quiz Progression

Users can move to the next question once they've answered the current one. The JavaScript code manages 
the quiz progression and displays a "Finish" button when users reach the last question.

###Quiz Results

Upon completing the quiz, the project provides users with a summary of their performance, showing the number of correct answers out of the total questions. It also offers the option to restart the quiz.
